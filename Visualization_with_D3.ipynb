    "We can do the same thing in d3.  There are three main parts to this code.  Check out [John versus Jonathan in d3](projects/babyname/name_pairs.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The first part is the HTML tag which indicates where the chart will go.\n",

    "    ```\n",

    "    })\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    This is an asynchronous call to JavaScript.  That means the call returns immediately to execute the next line in the script.  When the file `data/birthnames_top_100.csv` is downloaded, the callback function (the anonymous function `function(error, data) { ... }` is then called with `data` representing the data that was loaded.  Hence, we must execute all our code in this callback.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A brief note: `data/birthnames_top_100.csv` is actually returned via HTTP (point your browser to [birthnames_top_100.csv](projects/babyname/data/birthnames_top_100.csv) if you don't believe me).  This means that this file could be any csv file on the internet and it could be an API response generated dynamically by a server.  In our case, it happens to be a static file you generated at the beginning of this tutorial.  The server that powers this notebook is translating the HTTP request to fetching the corresponding file from disk.\n",

    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This is actually using a library called `nvd3` which encapsulates a lot of the very basic functionality that `d3` offers.  Basically, `chart` specifies a bunch of rules for how to draw the data and `d3.select` binds (associates) the data with the html element set by the jQuery selector `'#chart svg'`.  This code demonstrates a few nifty aspects of JavaScript:\n",
    "    - **Chaining:** `nv.models.lineChart()` returns a `chart` object.  Calling the method `.x` modifies it and returns the new modified instance of the object.  Calling the method `.y` ...\n",
    "    - **Callbacks:** notice that both `.x` and `.y` require a function.  This function, when given an instance that will be bound to it (`d`), returns the attribute to set on the x and y axes.  The object `chart` is actually a function, which is called via the `.call` method by the selection `d3.select` with the data bound by the call to `.datum`.  Finally, the function `addGraph` takes a callback itself.\n",
    "    - **jQuery selectors:** Recall that \"#chart svg\" selects an html element with `id=\"chart\"` and an `svg` tag inside.\n",
    "    - **Global versus local context:** notice that while the typical variable assignment pattern is\n",
    "    \n",
    "        ```javascript\n",
    "        var chart = ...\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "     in here, we omit the `var`.  The `var` places the variable in the local context but here we want it in the global context, where we can use it again outside of this function (see below).\n",
    "    \n",
    "4.   Dynamic resizing.  The function `bindAndRender` is called when the page loads to bind (associate) the data with the chart.  Once this is done, all we have to do is reinvoke `.call(chart)` to redraw the chart.  This is done via a call-back associated with window resizing.  That is, the following line ensures that every time the window is resized, we issue another draw command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```javascript\n",
    "\t\twindow.addEventListener('resize', function(event){\n",
    "\t\t\td3.select('#chart svg')\n",
    "                .call(chart);\n",
    "\t\t});\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    Notice that we can call `chart` here, which was left in the global context by the function `bindAndRender`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise:** On the webpage in the above link, use `Cmd+Option+i` and click the console tab to enter the interactive JavaScript console in your browser.  Paste in these lines:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "d3.csv(\"data/birthnames_top_100.csv\", function(error, data) {\n",
    "    rawData = data;\n",
    "})\n",
    "```\n",
    "Type `rawData` into the console.  Again, because we didn't use `var`, the variable `rawData` is placed in the global context.  Follow the data manipulation steps in the source code line by line (you can view the source code on your local machine).  The code uses a small but powerful library called [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) which is imported as the symbol \"`_`\" (which is a valid variable name in JavaScript).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** In the above line of code, we save our data into `rawData`, a variable in our outer scope.  Why does this work in the console but would likely not have the intended side effect in a script?  Hint: this has to do with asynchronicity."
