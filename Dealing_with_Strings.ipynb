    "## The string data structure\n",
    "\n",
    "A string is a sequence of characters.  In Python it's indicated by surrounding it with either single or double quotes:\n",
    "\n",
    "        'The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog'\n",
    "        \"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog\"\n",
    "\n",
    "They are pretty much interchangeable.  The only difference has to do with __escaping__:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Escaping\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you wanted to enter the string \n",
    "\n",
    "        I'm Anatoly, but some people call me \"Toly.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "how would you do it?  You can't just surround it with `\"..\"` like \n",
    "\n",
    "        \"I'm Anatoly, but some people call me \"Toly.\"\"\n",
    "        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n",
    "\n",
    "because Python would get confused and think that the string was over early (as shown).  Similarly, you can't just enclose it in single quotes because of the single quote in `I'm`.  Instead, when you want to insert a quote into a quoted string, you _escape_ it by writing it as `\\\"` or `\\'`.  So we could represent the previous string as either:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \"I'm Anatoly, but some people call me \\\"Toly.\\\"\"\n",
    "        'I\\'m Anatoly, but some people call me \"Toly.\"'      \n",
    "\n",
    "(This also means that if you want to represent a backslash, you have to write `\\\\`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gotcha 1  (file away for later, don't think about now)\n",
    "\n",
    "That's in Python.  Other languages have their own rules and conventions and you often have to interface with them.  You should try to avoid dealing with these quotation and escaping rules in code -- it is a source of many bugs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In many languages, notably bash shell scripts and SQL, the two types of quotes are not the same.  What's even worse, each of three popular SQL backends (SQLite, MySQL, and Postgres) have substantively different rules about strings and about quoting!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gotcha 2  (file away for later, don't think about now)\n",
    "\n",
    "We never said what a character is, and it turns out to be painfully complicated.  After all, there are a whole lot of possible characters in a whole lot of alphabets, many more than the 128 characters in the [ASCII](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) character encoding that was once predominant.  There are a variety of systems, collectively called [Unicode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode), for _encoding_ all these possible characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you see a Python string that has a `u` in front, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "        u'I\\'m Anatoly, but some people call me \"Toly.\"'\n",
    "\n",
    "that tells Python that it is a _Unicode string_.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is something that you _shouldn't_ have to worry about: so long as you use libraries, and those libraries are smart, all the needed conversions should be handled for you.  Unfortunately, it is still possible to hit these rough edges so it's good to know about them."

It is good to think of a regular expression as a special type of program that tries to \"eat\" a string, but is picky about what it eats.  For a given regular expression, the \"set of strings\" mentioned earlier consists of those strings that it's willing to eat.  The more formal word for this is **matches**: A regular expression *matches* some set of strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some building blocks that apply to matching a single character:\n",
    "  - `.` : Matches any character (except a newline)\n",
    "  - `\\s`: Matches any whitespace character (`\\S` is the opposite)\n",
    "  - `\\d`: Matches any digit (`\\D` is the opposite)\n",
    "  - `\\w`: Matches any alphanumeric character (`\\W` is the opposite)\n",
    "  - `c` : Matches the character 'c' (and similarly for all characters that don't have some special meaning like `.` or `\\` or `[`)\n",
    "  - `[   ]`: Lists of characters, with ranges allowed: e.g. `[a-zA-Z0-9]` is the same as `\\w` in ordinary ASCII\n",
    "  - `[^  ]`: Some characters have special meaning inside brackets, for instance the caret `^` indicates negation.  That is: `[^a-zA-Z0-9]` matches everything _other than_ what [a-zA-Z0-9] matches.\n",
    "  - `$`: Matches the end of the string (or right before a newline)\n",
    "  \n",
    "Now the fun comes in when we build in notation for repetition and concatenation:\n",
    "  - `AB`: If `A` and `B` are regular expressions, then a string $s$ will match `AB` if and only if it is the concatenation $s = s_A s_B$ of a string $s_A$ matching `A` with a string $s_B$ matching `B`.  In other words, `A B` will eat a string only if it can first let `A` eat some amount and then let `B` eat from what's left over -- and they must both be happy with what they get.\n",
    "  - `*`: If `A` is any regular expression, then `A*` matches any number of repetitions of A.\n",
    "  - `+`: ... matches one or more repetitions.\n",
    "  - `?`: ... matches 0 or 1 repetitions.\n",
    "  - `{m,n}`: ... matches between m and n repetitions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Finally, if a regular expression _does_ match there's another verb that applies: **captures**.  If we put part of our expression in _parentheses_ `(   )` then it will be _captured_.  This  means that the matcher will remember which part of the string was eaten by the sub-expression inside of the parentheses, so that we can access it afterwards.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. In Python's `re` library, `re.match` requires that the match begin at the start of the string (though it need not eat all the way to the end).  This is not the \"normal\" behavior for regular expression libraries, which allow the match to begin anywhere: `re.search` gives this behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `re.match` returns a \"match object\".  It is not just a boolean value, but it _is_ \"truthy\" which is why we could write `if m:`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To get the capture groups we use the match object: `m.group(..)`.  Note that this is **1** based, not zero based.  (More precisely, `m.group(0)` is the entire string matches.  This is a useful behavior since it doesn't have to eat the whole string.) "
