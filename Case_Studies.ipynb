    "1. New users\n",
    "1. Retaining existing users\n",
    "1. Re-engaging lapsed users\n",
    "\n",
    "**The general technique:** (for any of the 3 segments)  Look at historical users and what explained their success:\n",
    "1. Demographic factors (gender, race, income, geography, age).  Most applications ask for gender and age.  Geography can sometimes be inferred from IP address.  Race and income are difficult.\n",
    "1. Actions taken (or not taken) on the website immediately after sign-on (e.g. add friends, page views, \"likes\", check-ins, leave a review).\n",
    "1. Social factors (in a social network), how active are their friends?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Actions you can take:**\n",
    "1. Email users (targeted messages, do certain types of users respond better to messages?).\n",
    "1. Customize the feed: most websites have a feed of content.  The content should be compelling to users.\n",
    "1. Pop-ups and other attention-getting instruments to drive desired behavior (e.g. add a friend).\n",
    "1. Social: get friends who are established on the website to engage with the user through the site.  Even if the action is not valuable for helping to retain the friend, it can be helpful to engage the new user.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important takeaway:** The global metric is clear (user growth).  However, you often need to break it down into intermediate local metrics (e.g. adding a friend, clicking on content etc.) and then understand how those local metrics impact the primary metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "**General proviso:** You probably don't need machine-learning.  Explicability is more important than precision in this kind of exercise, because the actionable insights gained have to be implemented by other teams.  A big exception is a \"feed\" where the recommendations can be machine-learned to optimize for a metric."

    "####Answers\n",
    "1. Send a small campaign to people you think are likely to convert based on ad-hoc rules.  Use this as training data.  How do you think about the size of this campaign?\n",
    "1. Run a classifier algorithm to identify who's most likely to respond based on user profiles.\n",
    "1. Ask for the lifetime value of a customer: $20.  Only send messages to people above a conversion probability threshold (which will never be less than 5%).\n",
    "1. Using the precision tradeoff curve, we should be able to compute the answers for various percentage cutoffs.\n",
    "\n",
    "####Things you should note\n",
    "1. A/B test messages\n",
    "1. Selection bias in the design of your small campaign:\n",
    "    1. You don't want to send messages to people who are not likely to respond (because you're not learning anything) but you might also miss a group of folks who could respond well.\n",
    "    1. Temporal effects (response on different days of the week vary).\n",
    "1. There's a lot of people on LinkedIn: target precision, not recall initially to validate the concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "####Extensions\n",
    "1. What if we are thinking about buying Google ad words?  Rhoughly speaking, this is the same problem except all units are per unit time.\n",
    "1. Ad effectiveness goes down with exposures so your elligible population is decreasing.\n",
