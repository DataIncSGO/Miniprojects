    "## NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've ever used MATLAB, you know that writing out loops to add two vectors / find dot products / multiply two matrices / etc. is possible but _very_ slow.  Instead, you should use \"vectorized\" built-in operations that can do the looping in a faster language or even pick a better algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is similar.  _Numpy_ is the package that provides the means to do performant numerical calculations in Python.  If you've converted your problem into linear algebra and matrices, then _numpy_ will let you write it to run fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why are Python arrays unsuitable for numerical computation?**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two basic reasons why Python on its own is insufficient here:\n",
    "  - _Data structure._  A Python list is a complicated thing. Just consider something like:\n",
    "        \n",
    "           x = [1, \"23\", BeautifulSoup(urllib2.urlopen(\"https://www.google.com/#q=4\")), 5]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    where x[0] and x[3] are numbers (of some sort), x[1] is a string, and x[2] is a complicated object.  If you're familiar with a low-level language like C, just imagine how this must be stored in memory: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    > In the typical Python implementation, this might be stored as a linked list of pointers to \"Python object\" data structures which in turn store what class the object is an instance of, a pointer to a dictionary (i.e. hash table) of instance variables, and a pointer to a dictionary of class variables.  This is reasonable for x[2], but for x[0] and x[3]...\n",
    "    \n",
    "  - _Typing and dispatch._  When we write `x[0] + x[3]`, what happens?  You can overload `+` for all sorts of purposes in Python, and the decision of exactly what `+` means happens at run-time by a dictionary lookup.  If you were term-wise adding two arrays, `x` and `y`, then because arrays can contain elements of different types this has to happen _for each term_.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What numpy does for us:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic thing that `numpy` does is avoid these two problems by using ordinary C-style arrays of integers, floating point numbers, etc., along with functions that operate on them intelligently. It also gives us C-style higher dimensional arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that C-style arrays are good for more than just quickly performing operations through Python; they're also good for talking to existing C and Fortran code. This interoperability explains why `numpy` matters to you even if you won't do any matrix computations by hand: many of the libraries that you _will_ want to use will use `numpy` arrays under the hood."

    "  `+`, `*`, `-`, `/`, `np.sin`, ... | All of the standard numerical and mathematical functions are back.  They always operate term-by-term.  That is, `x+y` is ordinary vector addition but `x*y` is term-wise product (not dot product).\n",
